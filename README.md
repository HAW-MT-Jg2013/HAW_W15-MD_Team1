## calculating a robot´s position based on VOR-like technology
There is a robot in a 2x3m field, which does not know it´s position. So there there are three VOR senders introduced to let the reciever calculate it´s position based on three headings to each of the senders (which positions are known).  
VOR is a technology used for navigation in aerospace.


## our VOR-adaption
currently there is a North impulse sent at 433 MHz and the circulating beam is realized by IR-light.


## more documentation
See the specialized document, which define interfaces and the technology for the senders and reciever.


## TODOs
see the github issues and milestones
